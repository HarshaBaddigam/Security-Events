# Rising Threats: Phishing Campaigns Exploit ChatGPT's Popularity for Malicious Intent

Many advertisements on social media platforms say, "free ChatGPT service can run on your system and with a 50$ credit". After clicking on the URL in the advertisement, you are taken to a website that looks like a genuine ChatGPT website. But "try now" is swapped with "download for windows." The malicious file is hosted in a different location and is a trojan. Many phishing campaigns are going on just like this to steal user information. Some even have a payment page to commit financial fraud by stealing credit card information.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Campaigns like these are familiar. Threat actors use trends like these to phish people into giving information. In the above case, threat actors hid their low-volume malicious applications in a buffer to appeal as legitimate to the general population. Threat actors are cashing on the popularity of ChatGPT. I've also come across a tiktok video that is being used to spread phishing links, saying they can change the filter. SMS fraud applications under the skin of ChatGPT are on the Google play store; when the users install these applications, they automatically detect the carrier and subscribe to paid services. The victims fall from losing money to identity theft. Whole organizations might be affected by a single infected system.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are well versed individuals in cyberspace, we must educate our families and friends to beware of such incidents. If not us, who will educate them? With our continuous watch on mass malicious campaigns, we can save some people from becoming victims. When we come across such websites and ads, we must report them to the proper channels.
