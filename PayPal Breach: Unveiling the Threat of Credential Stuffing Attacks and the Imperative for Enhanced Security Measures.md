# PayPal Breach: Unveiling the Threat of Credential Stuffing Attacks and the Imperative for Enhanced Security Measures

Nearly 35K PayPal accounts were breached. This is not an attack on a multinational company, as we see daily. Instead, the leaked data from different places were used to brute force into PayPal accounts. This kind of attack is called a credential-stuffing attack, where malicious actors use the username and password pairs found in data leaks on different websites. Malicious actors gained unauthorized access to the account holders' personal information, including name, DOB, SSN, and address. PayPal reset the passwords of affected accounts and provided a free two-year identity monitoring service from Equifax. PayPal advises users to activate 2FA for better protection against unauthorized access.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attack shows us how secure an organization's website may be; the data from different data leaks can be used to gain unauthorized access. It took a lot of time for PayPal to realize this credential-stuffing attack. I don't know why no-account lockout features are in place to prevent such attacks. In this attack, the data gained by the attackers can be used for identity theft due to PII exposure. The confidentiality of the PayPal account holders has been compromised.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, to prevent certain attacks, users must be prevented from reusing their passwords. After a certain number of failed logins the account should de locked, the account lockout feature must be in place. Organizations should check if any of their customer data has been leaked whenever there is a data breach. If the Organizations find anything regarding their customers, they should inform the customers to act.
