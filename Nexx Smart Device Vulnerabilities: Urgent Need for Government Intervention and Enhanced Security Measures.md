# Nexx Smart Device Vulnerabilities: Urgent Need for Government Intervention and Enhanced Security Measures

Nexx smart devices are vulnerable to multiple vulnerabilities. Nexx smart devices that are affected include garage doors, home alarms, and smart plugs. Sam Sabetan, an independent security researcher, published a report on January 4th on how malicious actors can exploit the vulnerabilities of Nexx smart-home devices. These vulnerabilities include credentials that are hardcoded in the firmware of a device, improper access controls, improper input validation, and improper authentication control. These vulnerabilities' severity ranges from medium to critical. For a further detailed explanation of each vulnerability refer to the following CVE IDs: CVE-2023-1748, CVE-2023-1749, CVE-2023-1750, CVE-2023-1751, CVE-2023-1752. Nearly 40,000 devices linked to 20,000 accounts are affected. A malicious actor can open the garage door to gain access to the victim's home, can turn off critical appliances.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No patch yet? Despite of researcher's report on vulnerabilities and multiple news outlets reaching Nexx, there is no reply till now. Does the government need to step in? The customers affected have no other way to protect themselves except by turning off the devices. Here Confidentiality and Availability are compromised.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these sorts of vulnerabilities are discovered, companies should act fast and patch these vulnerabilities as soon as possible. Not even alerting the customers is absurd. Strict rules should be in place to protect customer rights and data. The government should step in and question companies in cases like the above. Security teams of companies should be able to respond to independent researchers like Sam Sabetan to patch the issues as soon as possible.
