# Credential Stuffing Attacks: A Wake-Up Call for Loyalty Programs in the Sales Sector

Back in January, BleepingComputer emailed Chick-fil-A regarding reports that their user accounts suffered a credential-stuffing attack. In March, Chick-fil-A announced that it suffered a months-long credential-stuffing attack where 71,473 of its customers were affected. The threat actors used the compromised accounts to transfer money from saved payment methods to gift cards and changed those accounts' email ids and passwords. They used disposable emails. BleepingComputer had seen these compromised accounts sold on a telegram channel, and people who purchased these accounts posted pictures of their successful orders. The prices of these compromised accounts ranged from $2 to 200$. Threat actors segregated these accounts and priced them based on reward balance and linked payment methods. The victims' credentials are thought to have been obtained from various data breaches.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These compromised accounts contain Names, email addresses, membership numbers, mobile numbers, and masked payment information. Chick-Fil-A should have implemented MFA as some accounts have a large sum of money and saved payment details like credit and debit card information. Even though the organization hadn't been directly hacked, this greatly impacts how users should maintain their passwords. The confidentiality and Availability of the users and user accounts have been affected in this case.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users must be prevented from reusing their passwords to prevent certain attacks. After several failed logins, the account should be locked; the account lockout feature must be in place. Organizations should check if any of their customer data has been leaked whenever there is a data breach. If the Organizations find anything regarding their customers, they should inform the customers to act.
