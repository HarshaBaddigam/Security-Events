# Seasonal Phishing Campaigns: Safeguarding Against Tax Season Threats and Social Engineering Attacks

Have you ever heard of seasonal phishing campaigns? Yes, they do exist. It's that time of the year; I am talking about the taxes. Everyone in the USA is doing their taxes or getting them done. This is the perfect time for threat actors to attack accounting firms with phishing campaigns. These emails are used to spread GuLoader malware, which installs Remcos remote access trojan. This access is further used to spread additional malware, ransomware, and steal data. A malware we already discussed in previous, current events also uses the taxes season. It's none other than Emotet. These phishing emails contain fake W-9 tax form attachments and use OneNote to run VBScript and download malware. This phishing campaign targets individuals rather than organizations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phishing comes first place in social engineering attacks. The mindset of threat actors works as follows: Why break into a well-secured environment when you can find an easy way by manipulating people? As I always say, people are the weakest link in any system, even if it's well-secured. Here the confidentiality of the victims has been affected.
   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only possible way to prevent social engineering attacks is to educate people on how to act on the internet. Do not trust blindly. Take time, research whether it's a legitimate source, and act accordingly. Inspect with a keen eye before clicking on a link or downloading an attachment from the received email. This will keep the public safe from mass phishing campaigns. Organizations must start a cyber security awareness program irrespective of the department; anyone can be a victim, not just the IT department.
