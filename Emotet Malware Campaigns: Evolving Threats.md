# Emotet Malware Campaigns: Evolving Threats

We all use MS office tools. You may have encountered an infected word or an Excel document by now. There are a lot of campaigns going on at any given time; one of these campaigns is Emotet malware. This notorious malware used to be distributed using MS Word and Excel attachments containing macros with malicious intent. This malware steals contacts and contents of users' emails for future campaigns. It's also known that this malware downloads additional payloads to conduct cyber-attacks on the companies of the affected users. Once a user opens the document with malicious macros, it downloads DLL and installs the Emotet malware. Now that Microsoft has launched a protected view, these malicious macros won't be helpful. So, they turned to Microsoft OneNote for the campaigns. Users receive an email with OneNote attachment. When they open it, they are prompted to click on view. But there is VBScript file underneath the view button, which will be executed once it's clicked. The script downloads DLL and installs the malware.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the malware is installed, it performs as the command-and-control server dictates. Emotet spreads through emails posing as you to email itself to your contacts. It also spreads through networks. Emotat is known to target organizations once an individual in that organization has been infected. Malware spreading through email campaigns isn't new, but the malware sends an email posing you. Your contacts think it as you open it and get infected. Here confidentiality of the victims has been compromised.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft announced it's coming up with a solution, but we don't know when it will be rolled out. From the victim's perspective, they should be careful while opening attachments and read through the email before opening an attachment so that they might spot any malicious intent. Get support as soon as possible if you are infected.
