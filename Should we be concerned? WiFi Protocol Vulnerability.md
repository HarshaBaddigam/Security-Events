# Should we be concerned? WiFi Protocol Vulnerability

In the present world, we all are connected to the internet. Every device, from your computer and smartphone to your refrigerator, is connected to the internet. A small flaw in the network devices can through everything at risk. Security researchers have discovered such a flaw. The IEEE 802.11 WiFi protocol standard has a fundamental security flaw that allows threat actors to trick access points into sending the network packets in plaintext. When access points want to send network packets to devices in power-saving mode, they get queued. This happens when the access point receives a network packet that contains a power-saving bit. All the network packets sent to the device are queued or in a buffer; these queued packets are not encrypted. An attacker can spoof a device's MAC address and send a power-saving bit to queue the network packets. After some time, the attacker will send a wake-up bit to retrieve queued network packets.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here lies the tricky part, when an access point sends network packets to the device, it encrypts them. The attacker can change the security protocols by sending authentication and association packets to make the access point send the network packets in plain text or send their own key for encryption, thus succeeding in the attack. For all the above to happen, the attacker first needs physical access to your network's access point and then needs to intrude into the network. Here confidentiality and availability were affected.

I think not; the threat actors follow time and money spent vs. the information gained or their motive gain. This attack requires a long time of data capturing and analyzing useful information. Attackers will incline toward sensitive networks and organizations where there is a lot to gain. Once the cybersecurity researchers publish their results, the manufacturers will roll out a firmware update to fix this.
