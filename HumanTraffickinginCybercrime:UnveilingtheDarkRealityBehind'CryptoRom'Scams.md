# Human Trafficking in Cybercrime: Unveiling the Dark Reality Behind 'CryptoRom' Scams

Imagine you've met someone on a dating app and spoken for a few days. You feel like they are your future partner, and eventually, they ask you to invest in crypto trading on their suggested platform. A few days or weeks go by, as you trust the application and invest a considerable amount; everything seems fine until you realize you can't withdraw anymore. You are asked to pay some charges to release your funds. Now it's too late, and you have realized you have been scammed. These scams are called "pig butchering" or "sha zhu pan." This is one side of the coin; when you think of victims, you consider people who are being scammed, but in this case, the scammers are themselves victims of human trafficking. People from developing nations are trapped, in the hope of high-paying jobs, and their passports are withheld. They are forced to work or subjected to violence. These victims are called Keyboarders who are bottom of the crime chain and trained with a pre-written script to perform scams.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason for this to work is the victims (people who got scammed) are lured with false hope and tricked into using an application on the IOS app store, which we consider a secure platform as Apple always reviews an application before placing it on the app store. The perpetrators swap the malicious server with a legitimate server to pass the application review. What started as scamming people on online gambling sites in China and Taiwan spread worldwide after Covid-19. Victims sometimes lost between $1.2 million and $3.5 million, many of whom were well-educated. Chainalysis' 2022 Crypto Crime Report said $7.7 billion was stolen using crypto scams worldwide in 2021, an 81 percent increase over 2020.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned in the 1st event, humans are the weakest link even with a secure system. Public must be educated on navigating and spotting potential scams or scammers on the internet. Well-informed people tend to make fewer mistakes, reducing the number of scammed victims.
