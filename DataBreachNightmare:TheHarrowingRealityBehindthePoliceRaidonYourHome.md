# Data Breach Nightmare: The Harrowing Reality Behind the Police Raid on Your Home

While you were enjoying your morning tea, there was a knock on your door. It was the police. They raid your house. This is a swatting attack. Fake calls were made to the police about the house, and police were called to investigate. This was orchestrated by two men who hacked your ring cameras at your home and live streamed for entertainment. The attack was possible not because of a vulnerability in ring cameras but because the account that these cameras were linked to was created using compromised yahoo accounts. Perpetrators obtained the login credentials of these accounts and gained access even though there was 2FA in place. One of the methods of 2FA to access the account was sending a code to that yahoo account, so as you have guessed, it was easy for the attackers once they gained the credentials of these yahoo accounts. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The credentials of these yahoo accounts were leaked long back and are deemed useless at present, but the problem is that people tend to reuse the passwords. In this case, same credentials from that data breach were used. We understand that data from a data breach, how old it might be, can be used to gain access or gain a certain advantage. Here Confidentiality of the victims has been compromised.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that occasionally, we reuse passwords. That website might not have any sensitive information, but the password used on that website can be used to gain access in another area if it ever gets leaked. This attack wouldn't be possible if the victims changed the password and did not reuse the password. Never reuse passwords and we must educate people on checking whether their data has been leaked in any data breaches.
